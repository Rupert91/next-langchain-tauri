## Development

1. Ensure you have Node.js v20, npm, rust, and cargo installed on your system.

2. Installation
``` bash
   pnpm install
``` 

3. use [yao-pkg](https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg-binaries) to pack the server into a single executable file and make it as a sidecar binary for Tauri, before packing you need to check your computer arch by running:
``` bash
   rustc -Vv | grep host | cut -f2 -d' '
```
then change the word ```server-x86_64-apple-darwin``` to ```server-yours``` in packages.json

save and run:
``` bash
   pnpm install -g @yao-pkg/pkg
   pnpm pkg-server
```

4. Run in dev mode
``` bash
   pnpm tauri dev
```

5. The langchain part is in ./server , you need to run ```pnpm build-server``` after development, and run ```node ./build/server.js``` to test.
